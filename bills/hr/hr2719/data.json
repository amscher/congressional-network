Requires the Administrator, by 30 days before any TSA award of a contract for acquisitions exceeding $30 million, to report to Congress the results of the acquisition analysis and certify that the security benefits justify the contract cost.\n\nDirects the appropriate TSA acquisition official to establish certain performance baseline requirements before any TSA security-related technology acquisition. Requires that official to review and assess each acquisition for meeting the baseline requirements and to report those results to Congress.\n\nRequires the Administrator, before the procurement of additional quantities of equipment to fulfill a TSA mission need, to utilize, to the extent practicable, any existing units in the TSA's inventory to meet that need.\n\nDirects the Administrator to report annually to Congress on TSA's goals for contracting with small businesses, including small and disadvantaged businesses.\n\n(Sec. 4) Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to assess TSA's implementation of GAO recommendations regarding the acquisition of security-related technology that were made before enactment of this Act.\n\nDirects the GAO to evaluate TSA's progress in implementing this Act.\n\n(Sec. 5) Directs the Administrator to report to Congress on the feasibility of tracking TSA transportation security-related technology through automated information and data capture technologies.\n\n(Sec. 6) Directs the GAO to evaluate TSA's testing and evaluation of security-related technologies.\n\n(Sec. 7) States that no additional funds are authorized to carry out this Act. Requires this Act to be carried out using amounts otherwise available for the purpose."
