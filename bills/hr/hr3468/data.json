Applies the limitation also to any person with funds lawfully held in a member account.\n\nRequires the Board to provide pass-through share insurance paid by certain lawyers administering deposits or shares of any interest on a lawyer's trust account (IOLTA), or paid by the escrow agent administering other similar escrow accounts.\n\nDefines \"IOLTA\" as a system in which lawyers place certain client funds in interest-bearing or dividend-bearing accounts, with the interest or dividends then used to fund programs such as legal service organizations providing services to clients in need.\n\nTreats IOLTAs as escrow accounts for share insurance purposes, and considers them as member accounts if the administering attorney or escrow agent is a member of the insured credit union in which the funds are held.\n\nDeclares that nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing an insured credit union to accept IOLTA or similar escrow account deposits in an amount greater than authorized under federal or state law."
