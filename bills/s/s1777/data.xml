  <summary>11/21/2013--Introduced.
Innovate America Act - Directs the Secretary of Education, in coordination with the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), to award grants, on a competitive basis, to state educational agencies to establish or expand the number of STEM secondary schools in the United States from approximately 100 to approximately 200.

Defines "STEM" as the subjects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including computer science.

Requires the Secretary, in coordination with the NSF Director, to:

 develop a database identifying existing STEM secondary schools, and study and make recommendations to Congress on how to improve retention rates of students in STEM programs at institutions of higher education. Directs the President to ensure that at least 15% of all federal funds available each fiscal year for undergraduate research opportunities at 2-year and 4-year degree granting institutions of higher education are used to fund research opportunities for postsecondary students, with emphasis on undergraduate research opportunities during their first two academic years.

Expresses the sense of Congress that each federal agency should restructure its undergraduate student research opportunities for students attending such institutions in order to provide more research opportunities for postsecondary students during their first two academic years.

Requires the NSF Director to administer a Technology Commercialization Awards Pilot Program through which promising technology advances derived from NSF research grants shall be eligible for funding:

 to move the technology through the prototype and demonstration phases; for training for researcher participants in business plan development, technology transfer, and commercialization; and for establishing start-up firms based on the technologies developed. Amends the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 to extend the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program to cover specifically informatics and computer science.

Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a manufacturing assistance program for small and medium-sized domestic manufacturers to promote the manufacturing of goods in the United States and enable those manufacturers to be competitive in global markets.

Requires the Under Secretary for International Trade of the Department of Commerce to submit to Congress a report:

 identifying the 20 U.S. industries that export the most goods or services, evaluating their competitiveness in global markets compared to competitors manufacturing outside the United States, identifying domestic regulatory and policy barriers to increasing exports by these industries, identifying foreign barriers that impede the access of these industries to foreign markets, and making recommendations for legislative action that could be taken by Congress to reduce those barriers and improve such global competitiveness. Requires: (1) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), beginning in FY2015, to devise a strategy to reduce overall government printing costs over a 10-year period; and (2) each federal department and agency to issue guidance on the appropriate use of award and incentive fees in their programs.

Requires return to the Treasury of any funds intended to be awarded as incentive fees to contractors that are not paid owing to contractor inability to meet established criteria in this Act.</summary>
