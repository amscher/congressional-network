Requires states to spend, in addition, at least 3% of such funds in the first fiscal year after enactment, and each succeeding year, to improve the quality of care for infants and toddlers.\n\nRequires states receiving funds under the CCDBG Act to carry out: (1) not fewer than two of several specified activities affecting the quality of child care, which include training and use of early learning and developmental guidelines; and (2) criminal background checks for child care staff members of child care providers.\n\n(Sec. 7) Makes ineligible for employment by a licensed, regulated, or registered child care provider any individual who: (1) refuses to consent to a criminal background check, (2) knowingly makes a materially false statement in connection with such a background check, (3) is registered or is required to be registered on a state sex offender registry or the National Sex Offender Registry, or (4) has been convicted of one or more specified felonies.\n\nPrescribes requirements for the process of background checks, including fees a state may charge.\n\n(Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) provide technical assistance to states (which may be on a reimbursable basis), consistent with scientifically valid research, to carry out the CCDBG Act; (2) disseminate, for voluntary informational purposes, information on practices that scientifically valid research indicates are most successful in improving the quality of programs that receive assistance under the CCDBG Act; and (3) after consultation with the Secretary of Education and the heads of any other federal agencies involved issue guidance, and disseminate information on best practices regarding use of funding combined by the states.\n\nDeclares that nothing shall be construed as granting the Secretary authority to permit states to alter the eligibility requirements for eligible children, including work requirements that apply to the parents of eligible children.\n\nAuthorizes a state to request the Secretary for relief from any provision of federal law (including a regulation, policy, or procedure) affecting the delivery of child care services with federal funds that conflicts with any CCDBG requirement.\n\nRequires states receiving CCDBG funds to collect monthly information on whether children receiving CCDBG assistance are homeless.\n\nDirects the Secretary to operate a national toll-free hotline and website.\n\nProhibits any quarterly state CCDBG reports to the Secretary from containing individually identifiable information.\n\n(Sec. 9) Revises the amount the Secretary is required to reserve from annual appropriations for CCDBG payments to Indian tribes and tribal organizations. Requires a reservation of 2% of such appropriations (currently, between 1% and 2%), but allows for a greater reservation in certain circumstances.\n\nDirects the Secretary to reserve $1 million of the amount appropriated for the CCDBG program each fiscal year for the operation of the national toll-free hotline and website.\n\nDirects the Secretary, in consultation with Indian tribes and tribal organizations, to develop minimum child care standards applicable to any of them receiving CCDBG assistance.\n\nRequires the Secretary to waive the prohibition against tribal use of CCDBG funds for construction or renovation of child care facilities if it would decrease the level of child care services, in any case where: (1) the decrease is temporary, and (2) the level of child care services will increase or improve after the construction or renovation is completed.\n\n(Sec. 10) Defines \"child with a disability\" as one under age 13 who has a disability and is eligible for early intervention services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n\n Caps the family assets of an \"eligible child\" at $1 million.\n\nSec. 10A) Declares that nothing in the CCDBG Act shall be construed in a manner to: (1) favor or promote the use of grants and contracts for the receipt of child care services under the CCDBG Act over the use of child care certificates; or (2) disfavor or discourage the use of such certificates for the purchase of child care services, including those services provided by private or nonprofit entities, such as faith-based providers.\n\n(Sec. 11) Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to study the number of families eligible to receive assistance under the CCDBG Act who have applied for it and been placed on a waiting list.\n\n(Sec. 12) Makes a conforming amendment to the Public Health Service Act.\n\n(Sec. 13) Directs the Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Education, to conduct an interdepartmental review of all early learning and care programs.\n\n(Sec. 14) Safe Child Care Act of 2014 - Amends the Crime Control Act of 1990 to prescribe background checks by a state for child care and staff members, and makes a person ineligible for employment by a child care provider if he or she refuses to consent to such a background check, lies during the background check, or has been convicted of one or more specified felonies.\n\n(Sec. 15) Allows child care facilities in federal buildings to serve children of parents or guardians not employed by the federal government if the parent or guardian: (1) has met the requirements for a master's degree or a doctorate degree from an institution of higher education, and (2) is conducting research in the federal building under an arrangement between the parent or guardian and a federal agency.\n\n(Sec. 16) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should immediately present to Congress a comprehensive plan to reduce child poverty in the United States significantly by 2019."
