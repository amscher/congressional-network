Directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives to make corrections in the enrollment of H.R. 2061 (authorizing the presentation of a U.S. flag for federal civilian employees who die of injuries in connection with their employment) to: (1) authorize the head of an executive agency, upon the request of an agency employee's widow or widower, child, sibling, or parent (instead of the employee's "next of kin") to give a U.S. flag (instead of to pay the expenses incident to the presentation of a U.S. flag) to an individual who was an employee of the agency and who died of injuries incurred in connection with such individual's federal employment; (2) add the qualification that such injuries were suffered as a result of a criminal act, an act of terrorism, a natural disaster, or other circumstance as determined by the President; and (3) modify the definition of "employee" to remove individuals who perform volunteer services at the discretion of an agency head.</summary>
