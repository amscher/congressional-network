  <summary>5/3/2011--Introduced.
Drinking Water Right to Know Act - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to require a public water system that detects an unregulated contaminant included in EPA's list of unregulated contaminants to be monitored by public water systems and included in the national drinking water occurrence data base, to continue to monitor&#160;for the detected contaminant for such period, at such frequency, and at such levels of concentration as the Administrator determines to be appropriate.

Authorizes the data contained in the national drinking water contaminant occurrence data base to be used by the public. Requires the Administrator to: (1) evaluate the extent to which such data is accessible to and useable by the public; and (2) make such data more accessible to and useable by the public.</summary>
