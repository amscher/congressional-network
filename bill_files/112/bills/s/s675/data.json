Prohibits the governing entity from conducting gaming activities, unless Hawaii permits such an activity for any purpose by an individual, organization, or entity.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to consider the governing entity to be an Indian tribe for purposes of carrying out any activity authorized under the Indian Reorganization Act.\n\nRatifies and confirms any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act for the Native Hawaiian governing entity to the extent the action is challenged based on the question of whether the governing entity was federally recognized or under federal jurisdiction on June 18, 1934.\n\n(Sec. 8) Authorizes appropriations for the implementation of this Act."
