Restores or revives the provisions of law amended or repealed by such title as if it had not been enacted.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) maintain oversight of all outstanding funds received by an entity under TARP until they are repaid; and (2) dispose of all assets received by the Treasury under TARP in a manner so as to maximize the overall return from them.\n\nDeclares that Congress finds that the federal government should not: (1) provide TARP-like programs or other bailouts for entities in the private sector; or (2) act as a creditor of last resort to the private sector.\n\nProhibits Congress from making any law providing a bailout for one or more entities in the private sector."
