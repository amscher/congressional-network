  <summary>6/12/2012--Introduced.
Military Savings Act of 2012 - Directs the Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller) to carry out a five-year pilot program to develop innovative consumer financial products that encourage savings and wealth-creation among active-duty servicemembers. Requires the program to be carried out in such a way that it does not exacerbate the incidence of servicemember credit overextension. Directs the Undersecretary to choose at least 10 military installations at which to implement the program.

Directs the Undersecretary to contract for an annual independent program evaluation until its termination.

Allows the Undersecretary, under certain conditions, to expand the program to a nationwide program and to extend its duration.</summary>
