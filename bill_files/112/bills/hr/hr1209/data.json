Requires interim inspections upon a family's request.\n\nAuthorizes PHAs to establish specified alternative rent structures, except for elderly and disabled families.\n\nPrescribes requirements for reviews and calculation of family income.\n\nPrescribes eligibility criteria for assistance based upon family assets.\n\nRevises requirements governing: (1) assistance to low-income working families, (2) tenant-based contract renewals, (3) administrative fees, and (4) the home ownership downpayment grant program.\n\nAuthorizes a PHA to report to certain consumer reporting agencies information regarding the past rent payment history of a family receiving tenant-based housing choice vouchers.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish standards and procedures for assessing PHA performance in carrying out the programs for tenant-based rental assistance and for homeownership assistance, including biennial assessments.\n\nRevises requirements relating to: (1) PHA project-based assistance, (2) the monitoring of rent burdens, and (3) enhanced vouchers.\n\nDirects the Secretary to define market areas.\n\nLimits a PHA's elective applicant screening to criteria directly related to an applicant's ability to fulfill the obligations of an assisted lease.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to permit HUD participation in certain state demonstration programs providing for persons with significant disabilities to be employed and to continue to receive certain federal and state benefits.\n\nAuthorizes a PHA to use subsidy payments otherwise due the owner to pay for continued utility service to avoid hardship to program participants.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) publish regularly data regarding utility consumption and costs in local areas that will be useful for the establishment of allowances for tenant-paid utilities for assisted families; and (2) establish guidelines for the use of such data.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to provide preservation project-based voucher assistance in lieu of enhanced voucher assistance in the case of a multifamily housing project.\n\nAuthorizes a PHA, in the case of foreclosure on any federally-related mortgage loan or on any residential real property in which a recipient of public housing assistance resides, to use rental assistance funds: (1) to pay utilities that are the owner's responsibility, or (2) for the family's reasonable moving costs.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General to identify obstacles to using vouchers in federally subsidized housing projects.\n\nAmends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to revise the duties of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to study the effects of Section 8 programs on HUD's budget and programs.\n\nEstablishes the Housing Innovation Program to give PHAs flexibility to design, and HUD responsibility to evaluate, innovative approaches to providing specified housing assistance.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General to identify: (1) databases regarding incomes of families and individuals that may be used in conjunction with the Section 8 rental voucher and other public housing assistance programs to reduce errors in subsidy amounts provided on behalf of assistance recipients; and (2) how best to utilize such databases."
