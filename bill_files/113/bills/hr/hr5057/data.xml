EPS Service Parts Act of 2014 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to exempt external power supplies (EPS) for four years from energy conservation standards established by the Department of Energy in 2014.

Applies this exemption to service parts or spare parts for products that were manufactured before February 10, 2016.</summary>
