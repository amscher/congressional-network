  <summary>6/12/2014--Introduced.
Regulatory Certainty Act of 2014 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to define the period of time in which the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is authorized to restrict or deny a permit for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into navigable waters, and to prohibit the specification (or withdrawal) of a defined area as a disposal site, as the period that:

 begins on the date that the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, provides notice to the Administrator that the Secretary has completed all procedures for processing an application for a permit for dredged or fill material and is ready to determine whether the permit should be issued; and ends on the date that the Secretary issues the permit. Requires the Chief to ensure that the period consists of at least 30 consecutive days.

Authorizes the Chief to issue a permit for dredged or fill material only after the Chief provides notice to the Administrator.</summary>
