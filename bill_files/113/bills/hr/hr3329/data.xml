  <summary>5/6/2014--Passed House without amendment.
Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to publish in the Federal Register proposed revisions to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement on Assessment of Financial and Managerial Factors applying such policy to bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies having pro forma consolidated assets of less than $1 billion and which: (1) are not engaged in nonbanking activities involving significant leverage, and (2) do not have a significant amount of outstanding debt held by the general public.

Retains Board authority, however, to exclude either a bank holding company or a savings and loan holding company from such Policy Statement if exclusion is warranted for supervisory purposes.</summary>
