Permits the intergovernmental agreements to include remedies imposed by the tribe, including: restorative justice, community service, fines, forfeitures, commitments for treatment, restraining orders, emergency detentions, and any other remedies agreed to by the state and the tribe.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to submit an annual report to Congress including grants awarded, an assessment of the program, and any recommendations related to the program.\n\n(Sec. 5) Directs the Attorney General to establish the Alaska Safe Families and Villages Self Governance Tribal Law Project to make grants to assist Indian tribes in exercising concurrent civil jurisdiction on matters related to child abuse and neglect, domestic violence, and drug and alcohol related offenses.\n\nRequires each Indian tribe selected to participate in the Project to request participation by resolution or other official tribal action, meet specified criteria, and complete a planning phase certified by the Attorney General.\n\nPermits the participating tribe to exercise civil jurisdiction, concurrent with Alaska, over: (1) any member of or person eligible for membership in the tribe, and (2) any nonmember of the tribe that resides or is located in the remote Alaska Native village in which the tribe operates. Permits the tribe to exercise concurrent jurisdiction unless an intergovernmental agreement applies.\n\nPermits a participating tribe to impose civil sanctions, including: restorative justice, community service, fines, forfeitures, commitments for treatment, restraining orders, emergency detentions, and any other remedies the tribal court determines are appropriate.\n\nProhibits a participating tribe exercising jurisdiction under this Act from incarcerating an individual absent an intergovernmental agreement.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to report to Congress annually on activities related to the program.\n\n (Sec. 6) Absolves Alaska, including its political subdivisions, of liability for any act or omission of a participating Indian tribe in carrying out this Act.\n\nMakes participating Indian tribes eligible for the same tribal court and law enforcement programs and level of funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) as are available to other Indian tribes.\n\n(Sec. 7) Permits the Attorney General to enter into contracts with Indian tribes in Alaska to provide technical assistance related to tribal court development and the proper transfer of evidence and information.\n\n(Sec. 8) Permits the Attorney General to use amounts made available for the Office of Justice Programs to carry out this Act.\n\n(Sec. 9) Amends the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 to repeal a provision prohibiting Alaska tribes other than the Metlakatla Indian Community from issuing and enforcing domestic violence protective orders against non-member Alaska Natives and non-Natives."
