  <summary>7/26/2011--Introduced.
Medigap Medical Loss Ratio Improvement Act of 2011 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act with respect to Medicare supplemental (Medigap) policies to increase the minimum loss ratio required of such policies. (A loss ratio is the ratio of total losses paid out in insurance claims, plus adjustment expenses, divided by the total earned insurance premiums.)

Prohibits the issuance or renewal of a Medigap policy in any state unless the policy can be expected to return to policyholders in the form of aggregate benefits: (1) at least 85% (currently 75%) of the aggregate amount of premiums collected in the case of group policies, and (2) at least 80% (currently 65%) in the case of individual policies.</summary>
