Directs the Undersecretary to choose at least 10 military installations at which to implement the program.\n\nDirects the Undersecretary to contract for an annual independent program evaluation until its termination.\n\nAllows the Undersecretary, under certain conditions, to expand the program to a nationwide program and to extend its duration."
