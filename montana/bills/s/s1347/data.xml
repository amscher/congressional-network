  <summary>7/23/2013--Introduced.
Conference Accountability Act of 2013 - Prohibits an agency from paying the travel expenses for more than 50 employees stationed in the United States to attend any international conference, unless the Secretary of State determines that attendance of such employees is in the national interest.

Requires each agency to post on its public website: (1) quarterly reports, in a searchable electronic format, on each conference for which the agency paid travel expenses during the preceding three months; and (2) detailed information on any presentation made by any agency employee at a conference.

Limits agency travel expenses for FY2014-FY2018 to 80% of the aggregate amount of such expenses for FY2010. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), not later than September 1, 2013, to establish guidelines for determining what expenses constitute travel expenses for purposes of the ceiling imposed on such expenses.

Limits to $500,000 the amount that any agency may spend to support a single conference. Prohibits an agency from funding more than one conference that is sponsored or organized by a particular organization during any fiscal year, unless the agency is the primary sponsor and organizer of the conference.</summary>
