  <summary>11/13/2013--Introduced.
Border Patrol Agent Pay Reform Act of 2013 - Sets forth additional&#160;requirements relating to the rates of pay and terms of employment&#160;for U.S. Border Patrol agents (i.e., federal employees who detect and prevent illegal entry and smuggling of aliens, commercial goods, narcotics, weapons, or contraband into the United States).

Requires Border Patrol agents to elect each year to: (1) be assigned to either a specified&#160;level one or level two border patrol rate of pay governing regular rates of pay&#160;and overtime work requirements,&#160;or (2) decline to be assigned to either level.&#160;Expresses the sense of Congress that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) should ensure that not more than 10% of agents stationed at a location decline to be assigned to either the level 1 or level 2 border patrol rate of pay. Empowers CBP, without limitation, to require agents to perform overtime work in accordance with agency needs, including if needed in the event of a local or national emergency.</summary>
