Absolves Alaska, including its political subdivisions, of liability for any act or omission of a participating Indian tribe in carrying out this Act.\n\nMakes participating Indian tribes eligible for the same tribal court and law enforcement programs and level of funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as are available to other Indian tribes.\n\nAmends the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 to repeal the limitation, within Alaska, of that Act's extension of tribal jurisdiction over domestic violence crimes and the issuance and enforcement of protection orders."
