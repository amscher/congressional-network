Authorizes the FTC to promulgate regulations to carry out this Act.\n\nAuthorizes states to bring civil actions in federal court to obtain injunctive relief on behalf of state residents unless a civil or administrative action has already been instituted by the FTC. Allows the FTC to intervene and appeal in state actions."
