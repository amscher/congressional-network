  <summary>12/19/2013--Introduced.
Migratory Bird Habitat Investment and Enhancement Act - Amends the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act to allow the Secretary of the Interior, for each 5-year period beginning in 2014, to set the amount to be collected for each Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp sold under the Act. Limits such amount to $25 for the initial 5-year period and to $30 for the subsequent 5-year period.

Requires the United States Postal Service (USPS) and the Department of the Interior, or any other agent approved by the Department&#160;to collect the amount established for each Stamp sold for a hunting year if the Secretary determines, at any time before February 1 of a calendar year, that all amounts in the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund have been obligated for expenditure.

Permits the Secretary, in consultation with the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, to waive requirements under the Act relating to the prohibition on the taking of migratory waterfowl with respect to certain individuals as determined to be appropriate.</summary>
