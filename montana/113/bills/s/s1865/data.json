Limits such amount to $25 for the initial 5-year period and to $30 for the subsequent 5-year period.\n\nRequires the United States Postal Service (USPS) and the Department of the Interior, or any other agent approved by the Department\u00a0to collect the amount established for each Stamp sold for a hunting year if the Secretary determines, at any time before February 1 of a calendar year, that all amounts in the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund have been obligated for expenditure.\n\nPermits the Secretary, in consultation with the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, to waive requirements under the Act relating to the prohibition on the taking of migratory waterfowl with respect to certain individuals as determined to be appropriate."
