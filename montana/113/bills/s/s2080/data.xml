  <summary>3/5/2014--Introduced.
National Fish Habitat Conservation Act - Establishes the National Fish Habitat Board to: (1) promote, oversee, and coordinate the implementation of this Act and the National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHAP); (2) establish national goals and priorities for fish habitat conservation; and (3) review and make recommendations regarding fish habitat conservation projects.

Permits the Board to designate Fish Habitat Partnerships to coordinate implementation of the NFHAP at a regional level and develop and carry out fish habitat conservation projects.

Sets forth requirements for approval by the Board of a fish habitat conservation project. Requires property acquired for a project to be open to the public for compatible fish and wildlife-dependent recreation and be closed only to protect public safety, the property, or the habitat. Requires the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to establish the National Fish Habitat Conservation Partnership Program with duties to include providing funding for the operational needs of the Partnerships.

Permits the head of each federal agency to coordinate with the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Director of USFWS to promote healthy fish populations and fish habitats.

Requires the Director of USFWS, the NOAA Assistant Administrator, and the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to provide technical and scientific assistance to the Partnerships, the project participants, and the Board.

Prohibits using any funds made available to carry out this Act for fish and wildlife mitigation purposes under any federal law or court settlement.</summary>
