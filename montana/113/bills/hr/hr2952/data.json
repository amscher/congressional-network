Requires all technologies shared through the clearinghouse to include a set of performance and readiness metrics to assist end-users in deploying effective and timely solutions relevant for their critical infrastructures. Requires: (1) DHS's Privacy Officer to annually review the clearinghouse process to evaluate its consistency with fair information practice principles; and (2) the Comptroller General (GAO), within two years after the enactment of this Act, to conduct an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of and report to Congress on such clearinghouse and the centralized federal clearinghouse for information relating to technologies established under such Act."
