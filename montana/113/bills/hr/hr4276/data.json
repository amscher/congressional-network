Requires each quarterly report to include for the preceding quarter:\n\n the number of individuals who participated in the pilot program, the number of individuals who successfully completed the program, the degree to which pilot program participants and their family members were satisfied with the program, and the interim findings and conclusions of the Secretary regarding the success of the program and recommendations for improving it. Requires the Secretary to include in the report the Secretary submits to the congressional veterans committees after the completion of the pilot program:\n\n an evaluation of the pilot program in light of the VA's independent living programs, including an assessment of whether\u00a0 the pilot program should be incorporated into such independent living programs; and recommendations for improving the pilot program. Replaces references to \"assisted living\" with the term \"community-based brain injury residential rehabilitative care,\" including rehabilitation services within the meaning of such care.\n\nRequires this Act and its amendments to be carried out using funds already available for such purposes."
